# Battleships
Who will emerge victorious in the dangerous waters of naval combat? 
<br/>
<br/>
Battleships is a game played on a 10x10 square grid.
<br/>
Place 5 ships of differing length onto the square grid. This is 'your waters'.
The computer will do the same on their grid. This is the 'enemy's waters'.
<br/>
You will not be able to see their ship placements and vice-versa.
Take turns clicking on a single tile on each other's boards to send a 'missile' to that tile.
<br/>
A hit or miss will be registered on each other's board as you play.
Whoever sinks all of their opponent's ships first will be the winner.
