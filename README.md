# Battleships
battleships project for GA SEI-44 project 1 (WIP)
Battleships is a game played on a 10x10 square grid.
Place 5 ships of differing length onto the square grid. This is 'your waters'.
The computer will do the same on their grid. This is the 'enemy's waters'.
You will not be able to see their grid and vice-versa.
Take turns clicking on a single tile on each other's boards to send a 'missile' to that tile.
A hit or miss will be registered on your view of the opponent's board.
Whoever sinks all of their opponent's ships first will be the winner.
